# snake-neat
This repository contains an implementation of the classic game "Snake" using Python and the NeuroEvolution of Augmenting Topologies (NEAT) algorithm. The goal of this project is to train an AI to play Snake using genetic algorithms and neural networks.

The code in this repository is based on the tutorial series ["Game Development with Python - Snake using Pygame"](https://www.techwithtim.net/tutorials/game-development-with-python/snake-pygame/snake-tutorial-1) by Tech With Tim. The tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to create the Snake game using Python and Pygame.

In this project, we extend the original game with a NEAT implementation. The NEAT algorithm is used to evolve artificial neural networks, which control the snake in the game. Over time, the algorithm learns to play the game by evolving generations of snakes, each improving upon the last.

Please note that this project is for educational purposes and should be used as a learning resource.
